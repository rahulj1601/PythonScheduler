What does this program do?

For Task 1:
- Keep in mind that a comedian can only have their show marketed to a demographic if the comedian's themes contain every topic the demographic likes to see in their comedy shows.
- Furthermore, a comedian can only perform one main show a day, and a maximum of two main shows over the course of the week.
- There will always be 25 demographics, one for each slot in the week, but the number of comedians will vary.
- In some problems, demographics will have 2 topics and in others 3 topics.
- A comedian will have between 3-8 different themes.

For Tasks 2 and 3:
- A comedian can only have their test show marketed to a demographic if the comedian's themes contain at least one topic that the demographic likes to see in their comedy shows.
- Comedians can only manage 4 hours of stage time a week, where main shows are 2 hours and test shows are 1 hour.
- A Comedian cannot be on stage for more than 2 hours a day.
- Task 3 builds upon Task 2 as it requires us to minimise the cost of hiring comedians and aim to come as close as possible to the optimal cost
